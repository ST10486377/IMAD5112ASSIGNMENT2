The app gives users 5 history-related true/false questions. It shows instant feedback (“Correct” or “Incorrect”), keeps track of your score, and gives a final result at the end. There’s also a review screen to go over all the questions and their correct answers.

How It Works
	•	You start on a Welcome screen.
	•	Tap Start to begin the quiz.
	•	Each screen shows one True/False question.
	•	After answering, the app tells you if you’re right or wrong.
	•	Once all 5 questions are done, you see your final score and get a short message based on how well you did.
	•	You can then review the correct answers or exit the app.

I tested the app manually on an Android emulator and ensured all screens, buttons, and logic work correctly.
Tools & Tech Used
